This is a simple traffic simulation created in Unity. It features cars driving on roads, and pedestrian crossings where the cars will yield.

## Environment
Unity **2020.2.2f1**

### Setup environment
In order to setup a development environment you need to install
- Unity Hub
- Unity

You can install 
1. *Visual Studio 2019 community edition* to have an easy intellisense, it comes with .NET and everything you need to code for Unity.

2. Alternatively you'd need to install manually:
- .NET Framework
- [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
- VSCode

> The last approach may have issues for macos.
